# injecthook
Generic injector and dll with hooks to readfile, writefile and memory handling routines.

Include injector and dll. Only x86 supported yet, but will add support for x64 soon. 
Hopefully it is a simple enough to use and to modify so that anyone can hook their APIs and analyze/modify the content.
